# Adaline implementation

To execute, make sure you have Node installed in your machine and run the following commands:

```bash
cd src
```

```bash
node adaline.js > out.ppm
```

You can change criaTreinamento parameters to receive OR, AND or XOR, like following:

```javascript
adaline.criaTreinamento(AND);
adaline.criaTreinamento(OR);
adaline.criaTreinamento(XOR);
```

### Thanks to Professor Marcelo Thielo, for making the base code available for learning questions.
